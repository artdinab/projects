If art is about expression of life or self, then why not try to express what it means for me to be in my relationship? The love but the stretching of our characters and the overlapping selves too? 
Is it really about happiness and sadness alone when looking at it from a distance? 
Is it constantly having someone's face in my view, as we sleep, as we eat, talk and entertain ourselves. 
The strange portions of the body that are suddenly dear. Some odd angle of chin for example, or view of knees or legs at an odd angle while in bed. 
But how are such life memories to be related back to other every day relationships? Is it a lie to talk about the news or my project, when the last thin on my mind was someone's chin?
