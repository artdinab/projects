If art is about expression of life or self, then why not try to express what it means for me to be in my relationship? The love but the stretching of characters and the overlapping selves? 
Is it really about happiness and sadness alone? Is it constantly having someone's face in my view, as we sleep, as we eat, talk and entertain ourselves. The strange portions of the body that are suddenly dear. Some odd angle of chin for example, or view of knee at an odd angle while in bed. 
But how does such life memory accumulation can be related back to "normal relationships"? Do I talk about the chin and the knee? No.
